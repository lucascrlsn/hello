Open source Python library for rapid development of applications that make use of innovative user interfaces, such as multi-touch apps. See [kivy.org](https://kivy.org/#home) for more information. I have tried learing KivyMD first but it appears it is better to start with Kivy.

A short five-video playlist great for getting the begginger started with APIs. 

** I have been building a Youtube GUI for quite some time now and can now say that it is mostly complete! The link to the project is [HERE](https://github.com/lucascrlsn/youtube). The GUI can download Youtube videos, convert them to MP3, generate a description file of your video, and create a written transcript of the audio. Please let me know what you think! (p.s., if you want to use it yourself be sure to install ffmpeg and also get your API key.)

Probably the largest hurdle when learning any new programming language is simply knowing where to get started. This is why we, Chris and Susan, decided to create this series about Python for Beginners!

Even though we won’t cover everything there is to know about Python in the course, we want to make sure we give you the foundation on programming in Python, starting from common everyday code and scenarios. At the end of the course, you’ll be able to go and learn on your own, for example with docs, tutorials, or books.
